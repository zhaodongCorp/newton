    Test that particle-particle friction correctly uses relative velocity.

    This test verifies the fix for the bug where friction was computed using
    absolute velocity instead of relative velocity:
        WRONG: vt = v - n * vn        (uses absolute velocity v)
        RIGHT: vt = vrel - n * vn     (uses relative velocity vrel)

    Setup:
    - Two particles in contact (overlapping slightly)
    - Both particles moving with the same tangential velocity
    - With friction coefficient > 0

    Expected behavior:
    - Since relative tangential velocity is zero, friction should not
      affect their relative motion
    - Both particles should continue moving together at the same velocity
      (modulo normal contact forces)

    If the bug existed (using absolute velocity), the friction would
    incorrectly compute a non-zero tangential component and try to
    slow down both particles differently.

    Test that friction DOES affect particles with different tangential velocities.

    This is the complementary test - when particles have different tangential
    velocities, friction should work to equalize them.

    Notes on test design:
    - Particle-particle friction in XPBD is applied during constraint projection while particles are in contact.
      If particles are not kept in sustained contact, you may only get a single contact correction and the
      effect of friction can be near-zero and noisy.
    - To make this robust, we apply equal-and-opposite forces along the contact normal so the particles stay
      pressed together while sliding tangentially, and we compare against a mu=0 baseline.
