class Model:
    """
    Represents the static (non-time-varying) definition of a simulation model in Newton.

    The Model class encapsulates all geometry, constraints, and parameters that describe a physical system
    for simulation. It is designed to be constructed via the ModelBuilder, which handles the correct
    initialization and population of all fields.

    Key Features:
        - Stores all static data for simulation: particles, rigid bodies, joints, shapes, soft/rigid elements, etc.
        - Supports grouping of entities by world using world indices (e.g., `particle_world`, `body_world`, etc.).
          - Index -1: global entities shared across all worlds.
          - Indices 0, 1, 2, ...: world-specific entities.
        - Grouping enables:
          - Collision detection optimization (e.g., separating worlds)
          - Visualization (e.g., spatially separating worlds)
          - Parallel processing of independent worlds

    Note:
        It is strongly recommended to use the :class:`ModelBuilder` to construct a Model.
        Direct instantiation and manual population of Model fields is possible but discouraged.
